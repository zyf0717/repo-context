# Research: Repo Context Explorer

## Decision

Build the FastContext-style repository explorer harness first, expose it through
the CLI, then wrap it with MCP.

## Source Plan Reconciliation

Two source plans were considered:

- Local Context MCP Server: MCP-first context retrieval adapter over a ranked
  endpoint.
- FastContext Repository Explorer: CLI-first local read-only exploration harness
  around an OpenAI-compatible model endpoint.

The selected approach is the FastContext explorer shape because it makes local
read-only repository access and citation generation the core capability. MCP is
valuable, but it should be an adapter over that core rather than the component
that owns exploration logic.

Primary upstream references:

- [Microsoft FastContext README](https://github.com/microsoft/fastcontext)
- [FastContext model card](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/FastContext-1.0-4B-SFT)
- [FastContext paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2606.14066v1)

## Rationale

- CLI-first is easier to test independently from MCP clients.
- A single core reduces duplicate safety checks and divergent behavior.
- FastContext-style exploration fits the desired use case: ask focused questions
  about unfamiliar code and get compact file-line evidence.
- The upstream FastContext shape delegates exploration to a dedicated subagent,
  exposes read-only Read/Glob/Grep tools, supports same-turn parallel tool
  calls, and returns compact file-line citations.
- OpenAI-compatible chat completions are a narrower first backend target than a
  generic ranked context-search endpoint.
- The deferred MCP-first tools (`context_search`, `context_pack`, `context_get`)
  require a different backend contract and should not block the MVP.

## Technology Choices

- Python 3.13+ for modern typing, local filesystem ergonomics, and endpoint
  client simplicity.
- `uv` for package and environment management.
- `httpx` for OpenAI-compatible HTTP requests.
- `pydantic` and `pydantic-settings` for config and structured model types.
- `pytest` plus mocked HTTP transport for endpoint-independent tests.
- `ruff` and `pyright` or `mypy` for release gates.
- Official MCP Python SDK for the adapter after the CLI/core path is stable.

## Security Conclusions

- The model may request tool calls, but local code owns enforcement.
- All file paths must be resolved under `repo_root` after symlink resolution.
- Denylisted files must be rejected before content is read or logged.
- Tool observations must be capped and truncation must be explicit.
- Repository writes are out of scope for every interface.

## Deferred Decisions

- Exact CLI framework: `argparse` is dependency-light; `typer` is more ergonomic.
  Choose during implementation based on desired dependency footprint.
- Type checker: `pyright` is stricter for modern typing; `mypy` is more common
  in Python package CI. Either is acceptable if enforced consistently.
- MCP transport details: defer until the core run contract is stable.
